# Three

A small visualization that renders a 3D starfield from a local star catalog (`data.json`).

Features:
- Loads star data and converts celestial coordinates (RA/Dec) to 3D positions.
- Renders individual stars as spheres with color, size (based on magnitude), and a glow.
- Adds a background starfield for ambiance and basic interaction (hover, click to view star info).



Running
-------
Click application in iOS

```

Notes:

- Make sure `data.json` is present in the same directory so application can fetch it.
